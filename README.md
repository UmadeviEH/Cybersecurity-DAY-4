Topic: Web Development Fundamentals for Ethical Hacking.

1. What is Programming?
•	Programming involves creating a set of instructions (code) to command a computer to perform specific tasks.

•	In the context of hacking, programming is essential, particularly for mobile and Wi-Fi hacking, requiring knowledge of key technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

3. Importance of Website Development in Hacking
•	Websites are primary targets for hackers, as many systems and mobile apps connect to them.

•	Understanding website development is crucial for grasping website hacking concepts.

5. Core Website Concepts
•	Website: A collection of web pages under a single domain, structured like a bound book (e.g., Facebook, Twitter).

•	Webpage: A collection of presentable data (text, images, PDFs, buttons, videos) displayed online.

•	Website Developers: Professionals who build, maintain, and update websites by structuring data into web pages.

7. Front-end, Back-end, and API
•	Front-end: The visible part of a software application where users interact (e.g., buttons, text, images). Key technologies: 
o	HTML: Builds the structure of a webpage.

o	CSS: Designs the webpage’s appearance.

o	JavaScript: Implements functionalities.

•	Back-end: The invisible part where logic and data processing occur (e.g., handling financial transactions). Key technologies: 
o	PHP: Used in websites for backend logic.

o	SQL: Commonly used for database management.
 
•	API: Acts as an intermediary (like a waiter) connecting the front-end and back-end, facilitating communication (e.g., sending a user’s login request to the backend).
5. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
  
  •	HTML Document Structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>This is My Website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is Heading</h1>
        <p>This is paragraph</p>
    </body>
</html>
o	<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares HTML5 document type.
o	<html>: Root element.
o	<head>: Contains metadata, SEO, and design/functionality code.
o	<body>: Holds visible content.
